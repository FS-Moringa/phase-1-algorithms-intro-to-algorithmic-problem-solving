# Introduction to Algorithmic Problem Solving

Welcome to this section on algorithmic problem solving! From the prework up to
this point, you've learned the fundamentals of JavaScript as a language,
including how to write functions and work with built-in data types, as well as
how to use the "three pillars" of JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling,
and Network Communication) to build small web applications.

In this section, we're going to shift gears a bit and leave the browser to focus
on one of the most important skills you can build as a software engineer:
developing a **process** for solving problems with code.

Developing your algorithmic problem solving skills will not only help you
approach labs, code challenges and projects throughout the rest of this program,
it will also help immensely as you begin to prepare for technical interviews
once you graduate the program! One of the most critical steps toward landing a
job after graduating is being able to demonstrate your proficiency writing code
during technical interviews, and having a rock-solid problem solving process in
place will give you much more confidence when confronted with a new problem.

The objectives for this section are to:

- Understand how algorithmic problem solving makes you a stronger developer
- Define what "algorithm" means
- Develop a process for algorithmic problem solving
- Understand the usefulness of Big O notation
- Identify the Big O of a given algorithm

By the end of this section, you'll have the core skills you'll need to develop
as you begin your journey toward mastering data structures and algorithms. Later
in the program, we'll revisit this material and move on to more advanced topics.
